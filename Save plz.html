		<h1><bold><center>History of Holi</center></bold></h1>
		<h1>Holi is a pouplar Hindu festival. It is also known as the "Festival of Spring" or the "Festival of Colours".This year Holi is celebrated on March 18 on Friday which is in 6 days!! There will be a fun game at the end if you stay that long. Festival of colors, the festival of love is also a joyous occasion to enjoy with near and dear ones, as it commemorates the victory over evil.On the eve of Holi, which is observed on the day after the last full moon of the Hindu month Phalguna, the festive transition usually occurs from harsh and dark winter to bright and warm springtime.Holi commemorates Prahlada, a Hindu hero dedicated to the worship of Vishnu, a major Hindu god. Prahlada's father and aunt opposed his faith and punished him by making him sit in the midst of a raging bonfire.Vishnu protected Prahlada, and the prince did not burn. This is one of Holi's legends.</h1>
